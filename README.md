# CrankNicholson-ExplitEuler
Explicit Euler and Crank Nicholson Scheme solutions for the Heat equation are modeled in Matlab.

There are Matlab files for two schemes: Crank Nicholson and Explicit Euler.

Several image files are attached for Temperature Contour Over Time.


These code were written as a university assignment.
